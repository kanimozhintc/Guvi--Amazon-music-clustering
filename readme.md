Amazon Music Clustering:
With millions of songs available on platforms like Amazon, manually categorizing tracks into genres is impractical. The goal of this project is to automatically group similar songs based on their audio characteristics using clustering techniques. By analyzing patterns in features such as tempo, energy, danceability, and more, learners will develop a model that organizes songs into meaningful clusters, potentially representing different musical genres or moods.The particular features have been selected for model to perform the clustering techniques.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Helps reduce dimensions while preserving variance and  K-Means Clustering, Elbow Method,Silhouette Score has been implemented in this model.Finally the visualization have been created that how songs are clustered.
